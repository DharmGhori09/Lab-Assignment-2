 Lab2-JS-Frameworks

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript's ES6 module imports and exports. It includes features such as generating random numbers, converting kilometers to miles, calculating reduced prices, and greeting users. The aim is to learn how to create reusable functions and practice modular JavaScript programming.

Features:
- Greeting Users: Prints a personalised welcome message for three users.
- Price Calculation: Computes the final price after applying a given discount percentage.
- Distance Conversion: Converts a given distance from kilometres to miles using a conversion factor.
- Random Number Generator: Generates a random number within a specified range.

 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed (Check with `node -v` in the terminal)
- A terminal or command-line interface to execute scripts
- A text editor like VS Code or Sublime Text for modifying the code if needed



 Functionality

 Greet Users
- Prints a personalised welcome message for three users: Jenil, Krish, and Dharm.
- Demonstrates the use of function parameters and outputs to the console.

 Price Calculation
- Computes the final price of a product after applying a given discount percentage.
- Useful for understanding arithmetic operations and function return values.

 Distance Conversion
- Converts a given distance in kilometres to miles using a conversion factor (`1 km = 0.621371 miles`).
- Enhances understanding of mathematical operations in JavaScript.

 Random Number Generator
- Generates a random number within a specified range using the `Math.random()` function and rounding techniques.
- Helps in understanding random number generation in JavaScript.
